This is the authors' code release for:
> **NeRFactor: Neural Factorization of Shape and Reflectance Under an Unknown Illumination**

> **TOG 2021 (Proc. SIGGRAPH Asia)**

This is not an officially supported Google product.


## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/nerfactor.git
    ```

1. Install a Conda environment with all dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd nerfactor
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate nerfactor
    ```

Tips:
* You can find the TensorFlow, cuDNN, and CUDA versions in `environment.yml`.
* The IPython dependency in `environment.yml` is for `IPython.embed()` alone.
  If you are not using that to insert breakpoints during debugging, you can
  take it out (it should not hurt to just leave it there).


## Downloads

If you are using our data, metadata, or pre-trained models
(new as of 07/17/2022), see the "Downloads" section of the
[project page](https://xiuming.info/projects/nerfactor/).

If you are BYOD'ing (bringing your own data), go to [`data_gen/`](./data_gen) to
either render your own synthetic data or process your real captures.


## Running the Code

Go to [`nerfactor/`](./nerfactor) and follow the instructions there.


## Evaluation (New as of 09/10/2022)

We were contacted a few times about the numbers reported in Table 1.
Here are the four sequences we used for generating those numbers:
`drums_3072`, `ficus_2188`, `hotdog_2163`, `lego_3072`, all of which have
been released (see the Data section above).

For all sequences, we used these validation views: `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7`
and these (uniformly sampled) test views: `49,99,149,199`.
